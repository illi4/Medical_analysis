# Using Machine Learning to predict no-show on medical appointments

In this project, I will build a model for predicting missed appointments. For this, the following steps will be performed:

- data exploration (learning about the data, cleaning and preparing the data)
- feature selection and engineering (selecting the most significant features and creating new ones) 
- selection and tuning a supervised machine learning algorithms
- validating the algorithm to ensure acceptable performance of the model

## Results
The results are saved in the [Jupyter notebook file](Analysis.ipynb) in the repository.
